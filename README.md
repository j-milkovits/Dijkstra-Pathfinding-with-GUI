# What does it do?
Simple program that finds the shortest path between two points with any obstacle between using Dijkstra's Pathfinding algorithm

# How to use?
1. Download jar file from releases
2. Run jar file (Java installation recommended)
3. Set two points by clicking twice, draw any pattern you want and press Start!

# Purpose
- Further training of ModelViewController architecture
- Small project to further solidify algorithms from algorithms and data structures model

# State of the program
- pretty basic, it works but isn't the prettiest
- Might add more algorithms in the future
