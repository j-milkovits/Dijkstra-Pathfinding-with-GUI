Ideas:
    ✔ create a new class to save coordinates, color, neighbors @done(07.09.20 - 22:57)
    ✔ keep stuff like panelMatrix global @done(07.09.20 - 22:37)
    ✔ get some comments rolling @done(07.09.20 - 23:19)
    ✔ comment start/endpoint code @done(09.09.20 - 22:01)
    ✔ Get the control panel done @done(09.09.20 - 23:24)
        -start button (maybe a Dijkstra Button?)
        -reset button
        -text field (choose start position, choose end position, draw obstacles -> press dijkstra if ready)
    ✔ rework gridPanels boolean to object attributes @done(09.09.20 - 23:39)
    ☐ comments

    WILO:
        Too tired
        Finished the whole control thingy today
        Need to get started with dijkstra itself
        Might wanna do some comments before that

Program Flow:
    ✔ Start Program via Main Method @done(07.09.20 - 23:20)
    ✔ WindowController starts game @done(07.09.20 - 23:20)
    ✔ WindowController creates panel matrix and creates gridPanel afterwards @done(07.09.20 - 23:20)
    ✔ panelMatrix gets added to GridPanel @done(07.09.20 - 23:20)
    ✔ Sets start and end point @done(09.09.20 - 21:49)
    ✔ Draws on panels @done(09.09.20 - 21:49)
    ✔ Presses start @done(09.09.20 - 23:39)
    ✔ panelMatrix updates all neighbours (saved in Hashtable? key node, value distance) @done(09.09.20 - 23:39)
    ☐ get dijkstra going
