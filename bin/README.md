# General information
## State of the program
- Logic is done, not that pretty tho
- Would like to add different path finding algorithms (A*, Bellmann-Ford, ...)
- I'd also like the improve the code and visuals
## Purpose
- Another shot at using the MVC-SOC model
- Training the usage of some of the algorithms learned in university outside of university environment
## How to use
- With jar: Just run the jar, set two points, paint some obstacles by holding down your mouse and press start
